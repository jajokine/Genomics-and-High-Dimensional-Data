MITx - MicroMasters Program on Statistics and Data Science - Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications - Second Project

The second project of the MIT MicroMasters Program course on Data Analysis analyzed a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, with the goal of unveiling
hierarchical structure and discovering important genes. The challenge was to find ways to extract meaningful information from a high-dimensional dataset
that consists of 511 rows and 45,768 columns.


**DATASET**

  - p1: The folder contains a small, subset of the data. It contains count matrix **X** along with "ground truth" clustering labels _y_, which were obtained
  by scientists using domain knowledge and statistical testing.
  - p2_unsupervised: The folder contains only a count matrix.
  - p2_evualation: The folder contains a labeled training and test set. 
  - -p2_unsupervised_reduced and p2_evaluation_reduced: These folders contain datasets with a reduced number of genes.
